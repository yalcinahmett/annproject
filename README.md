# I have built an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to predict the likelihood of customers exiting due to their other data.
# I benefited from this [article](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/predictive-modelling-using-ann-with-python-ab701f3199dc) and upgraded his code for 2024.
## Artificial Neural Networks are a popular machine learning method used to predict customer behavior. ANN models can also be used to predict customer churn.

## Customer churn prediction is a method used to increase customer loyalty and maintain sustainable customer-company relationships. This method is used to understand why customers leave and this information can be used to improve customer behavior.

## ANN models are one of the most common machine learning methods used for customer churn prediction. This method analyzes the data used to predict customer behavior and is used to understand why customers leave.
